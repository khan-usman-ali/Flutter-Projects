ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Flutter Project! ðŸš€

I've been working on a dynamic shopping app using Flutter, and Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase some of the key components:

âœ¨ Widgets & Features:

ProductHomePage: Utilizes ListView.builder and GridView.builder to display products in a responsive layout, adjusting to screen size.
ProductDetailsPage: Features a detailed view with interactive Chip widgets for size selection and a stylish ElevatedButton for adding items to the cart.
CartPage: Implements ListView.builder to manage cart items, with options to remove items through a confirmation dialog.
HomePage: Uses IndexedStack for smooth navigation between the product list and cart, ensuring state retention.
ðŸ”§ State Management:

Implemented CartProvider with ChangeNotifier to handle cart state, allowing for seamless addition and removal of products with real-time updates.
This project demonstrates effective use of Flutter's layout widgets, state management, and responsive design principles. Iâ€™m excited about the potential improvements and future enhancements!

Feel free to check out my work and let me know your thoughts!
