Weather App in Flutter 🌦️

Excited to share my latest project—a fully-featured weather app built with Flutter! This app pulls real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

FutureBuilder:
Efficiently handles API data fetching and ensures the UI remains responsive.

ListView.builder: Dynamically displays hourly and daily weather data, making it easy to scroll through forecasts.

Custom Weather Icon Mapping: 
Created a separate class for mapping weather conditions to corresponding icons, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.

Refresh Button:
 Added a UI refresh button that fetches the latest data from the API with a single click, ensuring the most up-to-date weather information.

Elegant UI Design: 
Implemented with Card, Container, and other widgets to ensure a sleek and modern look.

This project has been a great learning experience, especially in handling asynchronous data, building scalable UI components, and adding user-friendly features. 🚀

Looking forward to connecting with others in the community working on similar projects!
